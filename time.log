This assignment was extremely challenging as it didn't measure knowledge
of the algorithm more than raw debugging time. Having to wait 2-ish 
minutes to see the percentage was demoralizing more than anything. Most of 
the time debugging wasn't catching that I messed up the algo, but changing
storage elements and otherwise trying to effectively walk through. Perhaps 
a smaller mcts game would make for a challenging (in terms of knowlege) but
much less frustrating pset. The same algo would apply and would need EXACTLY
as much code, but a smaller game could speed up testing.
